# HDN Shell — Modern BASIC ROM Replacement for Commodore 64

> _Pronounced "Hondani Shell"_

HDN Shell transforms your Commodore 64 by replacing the standard BASIC ROM ($A000-$BFFF) with a powerful, modern command line interface. When you power on your C64, HDN Shell launches instead of the classic BASIC interpreter, bringing Linux-inspired features and productivity to your retro computer.
