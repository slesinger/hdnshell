# Server-Side File Editor (Console 2)

HDN Shell includes a full-featured text editor that runs server-side and displays on your Commodore 64's 40×25 screen. The editor is available on **Console 2** — press **`C=+CTRL+2`** to switch to it at any time.

The editor renders into a C64 screen-code buffer which is transferred to the C64 via the DMA service whenever the client requests a screen refresh — no BASIC or machine language editor code runs on the C64 itself.

## Layout

```
 Row  0 │ FILE  EDIT  VIEW  SEARCH  HELP       1/3 │  ← menu bar
 Row  1 │    1 ...text line 1...                   │  ← editing area
   ...  │    ...                                   │     (23 rows)
 Row 23 │   23 ...text line 23...                  │
 Row 24 │ *myfile.py  l42c17  512ln  edt           │  ← status bar
```

- **Menu bar** (row 0) — menus and open-file tab counter (`current/total`).
- **Editing area** (rows 1–23) — 5-character gutter with line numbers followed by 35 columns of text, optionally split into two panes.
- **Status bar** (row 24) — modified flag (`*`), filename, cursor position, total lines, current mode.

## File Browser

Press **F3** (or *File → Open*) to enter the file browser.

```
 /home/user/projects
 [..]
 [src]
 [docs]
  main.py
  README.md
```

- Directories are shown in **green** surrounded by `[ ]`.
- Files are shown in **light blue**.
- `..` navigates to the parent directory.
- Press `RETURN` on a directory to enter it; on a file to open it in the editor.
- Press `RUN/STOP` to return to editing without opening a file.

---

## Open Files (Tabs)

Up to **8 files** can be open simultaneously.  Press **F2** to view the list:

```
 open files:
*1. main.py
 2. README.md
 3. config.json
```

- The active file is highlighted and prefixed with `*`.
- Use ↑/↓ to change the active file; `RETURN` or `RUN/STOP` to confirm.
- The menu bar always shows the current tab index, e.g. `2/3`.

---

## Embedded Console / Shell

Press **F7** to enter the embedded shell.  Commands are executed server-side (the machine running the HDN Server) and their output is displayed in the editor window.

```
 console (esc=back)
 $ ls -la
 total 48
 drwxr-xr-x  4 user user 4096 Mar 12 2026 .
 ...
 $
```

- Type a command and press `RETURN` to execute.
- `DEL` deletes the last typed character.
- ↑/↓ scrolls the output history.
- Press **RUN/STOP** or **F7** to return to the editor.

This makes it easy to run `git`, `cp`, `grep`, or any other server-side tool without leaving the editor.

## Tips

- Use **regex** in Find/Replace for powerful text transformations, e.g. `^\s+` to find lines with leading whitespace.
- Open the same file in both split panes to compare different sections of a large file.
- Save frequently with **F5** — the `*` indicator in the status bar reminds you of unsaved changes.
- The console working directory defaults to the last directory visited in the file browser.
- When the cursor is at the beginning of a line, pressing `DEL` merges the line with the one above.
