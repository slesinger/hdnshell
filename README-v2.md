# HDN Shell — the most powerful Shell for the Commodore 64 EVER

HDN Shell transforms your C64 by replacing the standard BASIC ROM ($A000-$BFFF) with a powerful yet lean command line interface modelled after Linux. This preserves the whole C64 memory for your programs.
HDN Shell launches directly after startup, drastically enhancing usability, connectivity and productivity of your C64. Our goal is to make your C64 a real working machine without overhead from unnecessary GUIs.

## Administration on Speed
- **Simple commands** write `ls` instead of `LOAD "$",8,1`, switch drives via `#9`, copy files (`cp from to`), ...
- **Power of Linux** profit from familiar syntax and features like recall previous commands, screen scrollback, -h for help, ...
- **Ride the Snake** Run Python code directly, eg for calculations, batch actions, etc.
- **Integrated memory monitor:** Inspect memory easily for debugging.


## AI-assisted operation and code development
- **Documentation** Find help fast via searchable manual pages
- **AI chat** Too lazy to read? Get assistance and answers from a friendly bot.
- **AI-supported Demo and game development** Want to try an idea but don't know how to start? Let the AI help you and explain. 

## Connectivity and AI
- **Connect to the internet**
- **HDN Cloud integration:** Connect for extended features. Run HDN Cloud locally for privacy or use the free public server.
- **Direct access to CSDb** Query the database for groups and users, browse files and load them directly into the memory of your machine.  

Additional benefits
- **SD2IEC support:** Use device #10 (with Ultimate), including directory navigation.
- **Open source:** All code, including cloud server, is available on GitHub for inspection and improvement.

## Motivation

- C64 hardware is legendary; Ultimate makes it even better.
- HDN Shell improves speed and usability, so you can focus on productivity, not just nostalgia.

---

## Future Features

- Multiple command line sessions (virtual consoles) — switch like Linux (C=+1, C=+2, ...)
- Copy/paste on screen (maybe between cloud and C64!)
- Write programs in the cloud, use them on your C64
- Prglets: relocatable small resident programs
- SID/MOD background music playback
- Simple file editor ([speedscript](https://github.com/gillham/speedscript))
- Replace Ultimate web app with a more integrated, powerful cloud solution
